# config-react-scripts

Custom configurations for `create-react-app`.

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  
Please refer to its documentation:

* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.
* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Installation

`create-react-app my-app --scripts-version config-react-scripts`

## Configurations

Currently the only additional configuration is CSS Modules.  In the future I will be adding more if the need arises.
